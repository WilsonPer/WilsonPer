Hi 👋 My name is Wilson
=======================

IT Specialist | Help Desk Specialist
------------------------------------

At the start of 2022, I wanted to focus and better develop my technical skills. I'm currently progressing through the Google IT Support course, and next on my list is CompTIA A+. Ultimately I want to find a job in the CyberSecurity field, but you have to learn how to crawl/walk before you can run. I'm at working on strengthening the foundational skills to better help myself and others.
